Letâ€™s imagine a team of six people developing a Python-based NLP application using PyTorch. The model involves training or fine-tuning a transformer-based LLM (e.g., a custom BERT variant). As release nears, a CI pipeline becomes critical for maintaining code quality, catching errors early, and ensuring reproducibility.

For linting, common tools in Python are flake8, pylint, or black (for formatting). These help enforce code consistency and catch stylistic or minor semantic issues.

Testing in Python is commonly done with pytest. For ML-specific pipelines, we may also use unittest.mock to simulate data loading or GPU environments. It's useful to isolate preprocessing steps and evaluate training utilities separately from full model training.

While building in Python doesn't involve compiling binaries, it may involve packaging the project using setuptools, building Docker containers, or exporting models using torch.jit.

Aside from Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives for CI include GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, or cloud-native options like AWS CodePipeline.

Whether the CI setup should be cloud-based or self-hosted depends on multiple factors: GPU requirements, data sensitivity, cost constraints, and team DevOps expertise. A cloud CI might be easier to set up and scale, but for large-scale training, self-hosting on a Kubernetes cluster with on-prem GPUs could reduce costs and increase control.
